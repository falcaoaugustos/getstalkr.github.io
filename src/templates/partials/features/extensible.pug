          | stalkr is entirely built with extensibility in mind: our plugins-based architecture ensures that you can pick and deploy only the right portions of code (client + server) related to the tools you want us to integrate withâ€“and you can write yours too: if you want, for example, to integrate with a repository management service for which there's no integration already developed, you can simply write one on your own!
